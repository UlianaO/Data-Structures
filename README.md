# Data-Structures

### 1. Notation Converter
The program converts between three common mathemtical notations for arithmetic.
1. Postfix(Reverse Polish) where operators are written after operands. <br />
   [ A B - + == (A - B) + C ] 
2. Infix where operators are between the operands.
3. Prefix(Polish) where operators are written before operands. <br />
   [ * - A B C == (A - B) * C ]

### 2. Huffman Code Generator
This program was implemented based on David Huffman`s algorithm: it compresses data without losing any details. <br />
In the program, it is used to compress a given string. <br />
It assigns variable length codes to symbols based on their frequency of occurences in the given message. Lowe frequency => higher number of bits.

### 3. Dijkstra Algorithm

The program is implemented with undirected weighted Graph ADT to perform Dijkstra`s Algorithm to find the shortest path between two vertices.
